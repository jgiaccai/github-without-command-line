# Collaborating and sharing using GitHub without command line

This tutorial provides a brief but hands-on introduction to Git and
GitHub to exercise useful workflows within GitHub.  Git is a version
control system which allows files and data to be tracked synchronized,
which allows collaboration and reproducibility.
GitHub is a popular website that stores these repositories.

**This tutorial avoids using the command line**. Instead, we will practice collaborating and
sharing using either the GitHub website or GitHub desktop
application.  Why?  Because for many cases, it is enough.  Especially
if you are contributing to existing non-code projects, this may be the
fastest, easiest way to do it.  Git and GitHub provide collaboration
tools to all kinds of projects, and there are all kinds of good ways
to use it.

This serves as an introduction to Git.  After this lesson, you will
both be able to use Git, and feel much more confident taking a
command-line course Git course such as the [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) or 
[CodeRefinery's git-intro
course](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).

```{admonition} Why GitHub
We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
[GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
choose to host your Git repository on another platform.

The Smithsonian Institution has an Enterprise license agreement with GitHub, which we will discuss further at the end of this lesson.
